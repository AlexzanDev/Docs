The Feedback command is used to send a feedback about unified/ban to its developers.

## Permissions

Everyone can use this command, members of a group, administrators or even operators.

## Syntax

Just type `/feedback` in a chat:

```
/feedback
```

At that point, unified/ban will ask you if you want to send a suggestion, report a bug or a user. When you'll select the appropriate option, you'll be able to write the feedback in response to the bot.

> **Please note**: you can't directly write a feedback as the command value.

## Developers

This command is defined in the file `/Bot/Command/Feedback.cs`.
